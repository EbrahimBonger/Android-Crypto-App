# CSCI 4237 - Android Crypto

## The application has no significant limitation.
## However, throughout the development, I noticed some rounding inconsistencies 
## when it comes to trading an amount in decimal fractions.

## Therefore, for the sake of testing data consistency, 
## I would suggest using non-decimal fraction numbers.

## Besides, some key features of the app have not been demonstrated in the video due to time shortage.
## Those key features include contextualized error or success toast messages and shared preferences.
## Finally, all the general requirements have been implemented.
